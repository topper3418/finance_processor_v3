program runs
look up sessions
user chooses listed session or new session
-if new create folder for session
user chooses view or modify (only modify if new)
-deal with view later, or as needed
user gives filepath to new data (have it all in a folder)
program creates folder for session in session folder
-seems like session should be an object at this point
-there should be an init file in the folder, which describes stuff
session copies data to 'raw data' subfolder in session folder
session makes a 'processed data' subfolder in session folder
session makes the database if new, initializes all tables
-vendors, transactions, accounts, filenames, snippets

session opens the first raw_data file
-if filenames gets a hit, process the file in the way of that account
prompt user to type in the column name of each of 'Date', 'Memo', 'Amount'
program trims and re-orders the file thusly, then adds the "account" and "bank" fields.
add to processed data folder and save csv
add corresponding column headers to the accounts table
loop all raw_data files

go through all raw transactions
first make sure there are no exact matches in transactions table
next check all for hits from snippets.
print a pivot table for types

prompt user to go through a type or upload to db
-if type
-user enters row number to examine
-copy a snippet
-show all matches for that snippet, prompt to modify it, go back or add a vendor/type
-if vendors or types are added, add to snippets
-vendors/types should be checked against existing ones, added if new.
-repeat until user exits
if upload, data is added to db to save it
